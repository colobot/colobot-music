# Colobot: Gold Edition - music files
## THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY FOR TESTING GIT LFS - It's not being used officially yet !!
This repository contains music tracks for Colobot: Gold Edition project (https://github.com/colobot/colobot) that are an optional addition to game's data files (https://github.com/colobot/colobot-data). This repository also includes CMake scripts for converting them from high-quality FLAC to OGG format usable by the game.

The files in this repository are hosted using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/), make sure you install it before cloning.

The music files currently include:
* Original music from Colobot game, composed by **Daniel Roux** and prepared by **CoLoRaptor** to be also as stand-alone soundtrack album in the Vorbis meta-tags (by adding titles to every track and changing queue, that would be more suited to album release). This music was taken from original game CD.

# File formats and installation
The files in this repository are available in FLAC format (except for Intro files - we still don't have FLACs for them :/). However, the game can only play OGG files, so FLACs need to be converted first - it's done like this so we can keep high quality music available, but reduce the file size for use in Colobot data files. The conversion can be done by CMake scripts included here, but they require "oggenc" to be installed in your system.
You can change the quality of OGG files by setting MUSIC_QUALITY in CMake (this can be any value in range -1 - 10 including fractions, default is 3)
